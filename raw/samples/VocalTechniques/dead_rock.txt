[Verse]
My lovers betray me
The snake in my garden is hissing
In the air is the sweetness of roses
And under my skin
There's a thorn

[Verse 2]
I should have known
That God sends his angel in shadows
With blood in his veins
I watch the enemy
Givin' me the hand of my savior

[Chorus]
And I can't love again
With the echo of your name in my head
With the demons in my bed
With the memories
Your ghost
I see it
'Cause it comes to haunt me
Just to taunt me
It comes to haunt me
Just to taunt me

[Verse 3]
With sugar and spice
It's hard to ignore the nostalgia
With the men on their knees
At the gates of my heart
How they beg me

[Verse 4]
They say
"No one will ever love you
The way that I do
No one will ever touch you
The way that I do"

[Chorus]
And I can't love again
With the echo of your name in my head
With the demons in my bed
With the memories
Your ghost
I see it
'Cause it comes to haunt me
Just to taunt me
It comes to haunt me
Just to taunt me
