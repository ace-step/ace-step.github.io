[verse]
Sun dips low the night ignites
Bassline hums with gleaming lights
Electric guitar singing tales so fine
In the rhythm we all intertwine

[verse]
Drums beat steady calling out
Percussion guides no room for doubt
Electric pulse through every vein
Dance away every ounce of pain

[chorus]
Feel the rhythm feel the flow
Let the music take control
Bassline deep electric hum
In this night we're never numb

[bridge]
Stars above they start to glow
Echoes of the night's soft glow
Electric strings weave through the air
In this moment none compare

[verse]
Heartbeats sync with every tone
Lost in music never alone
Electric tales of love and peace
In this groove we find release

[chorus]
Feel the rhythm feel the flow
Let the music take control
Bassline deep electric hum
In this night we're never numb
