[Verse]
In a world so grand he roams the skies alone
His heart a heavy stone a tale untold
Whispers of his past echo through the night
A lonely dragon searching for the light

[Verse 2]
Once a mighty force now he drifts in pain
His scales once shimmered now they're dark with shame
Cast out by his kin in shadows he does hide
A haunting sorrow burns deep inside

[Chorus]
Roaming endless fields with no friend in sight
His roar a mournful cry beneath the moon's pale light
Tears fall like stars as he flies on his way
A lonely dragon yearning for the break of day

[Bridge]
The world turns cold the nights grow long
In his heart he carries an ancient song
Of battles fought and love long gone
A legend now but his soul is torn

[Verse 3]
Hoping for a day he'll find a kindred soul
To share his pain and make him whole
Till then he drifts a shadow in the sky
A lonely dragon with tears in his eye

[Chorus]
Roaming endless fields with no friend in sight
His roar a mournful cry beneath the moon's pale light
Tears fall like stars as he flies on his way
A lonely dragon yearning for the break of day
