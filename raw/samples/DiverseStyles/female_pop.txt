[Verse]
I don't care about the view
'Cause I exist for me and you
I live my whole life in this planter
I can't find my car so just call me the
Horny gardener

[Verse 2]
Mayflies land on me and tell me they just moved to town
Remind me of my cousin Dottie she could put five hundred seeds down
Used to have a little guy sit beside me but he died in '22
Hmm I think that I was that little guy
Whoa Tongue slip it wasn't mutual

[Chorus]
Sticky green time in the flowery bob
My top shelf's looking good enough to chew
Right now every fly in the town is talking to me and buzzing too
Daisy Daisy can you come outside to play or else
I'll put a garden stake through you

[Verse 3]
All the buzzers lockin' up their stems and suckin' up their cuticles
She breathes my air I got her light I'm like her cute little cubical
Some caring soul in my seat might say I'm rotting away it's pitiful
But she's the reason I go on and on and every single root'll crawl

[Chorus]
Sticky green time in the flowery bob
My top shelf's looking good enough to chew
Right now every fly in the town is talking to me and buzzing too
Daisy Daisy can you come outside to play or else
I'll put a garden stake through you
Oh my pot
Don't scrape
Oh no

[Verse 4]
Ah hah ahhah ahhah oohhh
Ah ahhahhahhah oh Hah
Ohhh oooh Oooh ohhh
Ah hhah Oh
