[Verse 1]
This song sounds like shit, but I need the money
Baby mama took the kids, she need that alimony
My broke ass ain't made a hit since the stone age
I'm allergic to success. Pass the Flonase

[Verse 2]
When I get that bread, the IRS take half of that shit
Put it all on red, all on red, triple that shit
Then I buy some head, buy some head, swallow that shit
Now I got her in my head, now she fucked up alla my shit

[Verse 3]
"Man what you tell her now that she tryna start all this drama?"
I said I got bigger nuts than Michelle Obama
I don't know what it is with women but I ain't good at this shit
Now I got her in my head, now she fucked up my sensitive

(Let the beat drop)
[Instrumental]
