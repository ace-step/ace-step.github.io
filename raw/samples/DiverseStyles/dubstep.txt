[Intro]
NERGAL!

NERGAL!


[Verse 1]
Grave opens, cold as steel,
He rises, blood to feel.

Flames roar, darkens the sky,
Weak ones tremble, all must die.


[Drop - Build Up]
NERGAL! [echoing growl]

[Chorus]
Oh, Nergal! Lord of fire and decay,
Oh, Nergal! Your fury burns through the night,

[Verse 2]
Ash falls, the earth shakes,
His fury, no one escapes.

Eyes burn, fire’s glow,
Nergal’s wrath, the end we know.

[Drop - Build Up]
NERGAL! [echoing growl

[Chorus]
Oh, Nergal! Lord of fire and decay,
Oh, Nergal! Your fury burns through the night,


[Drop - Build Up]
NERGAL!
Fury… consumes.


[Verse 3]
Ash rains, the gods fade,
His power, all must trade.

Shadow calls, no escape,
The world cracks, it cannot break.


[Pre-Chorus - Suspenseful]
Nergal’s wrath, his final reign,
All is lost, all is slain.


[Chorus]
Oh, Nergal! Lord of fire and decay,
Oh, Nergal! Your fury scorches the land.


[Drop - Final Descent]
NERGAL!
The end… is here.


[Outro - Fade]
[Whispers of "NERGAL" echo]
