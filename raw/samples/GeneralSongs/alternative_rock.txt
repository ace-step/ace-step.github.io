[verse]
Bright lights flashing in the city sky
Running fast and we don't know why
Electric nights got our hearts on fire
Chasing dreams we'll never tire

[verse]
Grit in our eyes wind in our hair
Breaking rules we don't even care
Shouting loud above the crowd
Living life like we're unbowed

[chorus]
Running wild in the night so free
Feel the beat pumping endlessly
Hearts collide in the midnight air
We belong we don't have a care

[verse]
Piercing through like a lightning strike
Every moment feels like a hike
Daring bold never backing down
Kings and queens without a crown

[chorus]
Running wild in the night so free
Feel the beat pumping endlessly
Hearts collide in the midnight air
We belong we don't have a care

[bridge]
Close your eyes let your spirit soar
We are the ones who wanted more
Breaking chains of the mundane
In this world we'll make our claim
