[verse]
Woke up to the sunrise glow
Took my heart and hit the road
Wheels hummin' the only tune I know
Straight to where the wildflowers grow

[verse]
Got that old map all wrinkled and torn
Destination unknown but I'm reborn
With a smile that the wind has worn
Chasin' dreams that can't be sworn

[chorus]
Ridin' on a highway to sunshine
Got my shades and my radio on fine
Leave the shadows in the rearview rhyme
Heart's racing as we chase the time

[verse]
Met a girl with a heart of gold
Told stories that never get old
Her laugh like a tale that's been told
A melody so bold yet uncontrolled

[bridge]
Clouds roll by like silent ghosts
As we drive along the coast
We toast to the days we love the most
Freedom's song is what we post

[chorus]
Ridin' on a highway to sunshine
Got my shades and my radio on fine
Leave the shadows in the rearview rhyme
Heart's racing as we chase the time
