[verse]
Sunshine on the boulevard the beach is calling loud
Waves are dancing golden sand under a cotton cloud
Electric heartbeat pounding fast the tide is on our side
Catch a wave and feel alive we’ll take it for a ride

[verse]
Palm trees swaying left to right they know where we belong
Feel the rhythm of the night it keeps us moving strong
Sea spray kisses salty air we’re flying with the breeze
Champagne states of mind we ride we do just as we please

[chorus]
We’re riding waves of life together hand in hand
With every beat we chase the beat it’s our own wonderland
Feel the music take you higher as the shorelines blur
This is our world our endless summer as we live and learn

[bridge]
Moonlight paints the ocean blue reflections in our eyes
Stars align to light our path we’re surfing through the skies
Every moment like a song we sing it loud and clear
Every day’s a new adventure with you always near

[verse]
Neon lights and city sounds they blend with ocean views
We’re unstoppable tonight no way that we can lose
Dreams are written in the sand they sparkle in the sun
Together we’re a masterpiece our story’s just begun

[chorus]
We’re riding waves of life together hand in hand
With every beat we chase the beat it’s our own wonderland
Feel the music take you higher as the shorelines blur
This is our world our endless summer as we live and learn
