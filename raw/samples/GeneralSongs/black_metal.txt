[verse]
Floating through the galaxy on a midnight ride
Stars are dancing all around in cosmic tides
Feel the pulse of space and time beneath our feet
Every beat a heartbeat in this endless suite

[chorus]
Galactic dreams under neon lights
Sailing through the velvet nights
We are echoes in a cosmic sea
In a universe where we are free

[verse]
Planetary whispers in the sky tonight
Every constellation's got a secret sight
Distant worlds and moons we have yet to see
In the void of space where we can just be

[bridge]
Asteroids and comets in a ballet they spin
Lost in the rhythm of where our dreams begin
Close your eyes and let the synths take flight
We're voyagers on an electric night

[verse]
Let the piano keys unlock the stars above
Every chord a memory every note is love
In this synth symphony we find our grace
Drifting forever in this boundless space

[chorus]
Galactic dreams under neon lights
Sailing through the velvet nights
We are echoes in a cosmic sea
In a universe where we are free
