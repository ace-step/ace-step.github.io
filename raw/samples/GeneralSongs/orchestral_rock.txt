### **[Intro – Spoken]**  
*"The streets whisper, their echoes never fade.  
Every step I take leaves a mark—this ain't just a game."*  

### **[Hook/Chorus]**  
Born in the chaos, I weather the storm,  
Rising from ashes where warriors are born.  
Chains couldn't hold me, the system’s a maze,  
I rewrite the rules, set the city ablaze!  

### **[Verse 1]**  
Cold nights, empty pockets, dreams laced with fight,  
Every loss made me sharper, cut deep like a knife.  
They said I wouldn’t make it, now they watch in despair,  
From the curb to the throne, took the pain, made it rare.  
Every siren’s a melody, every alley holds a tale,  
Rose from the shadows, left my name on the trail.  
Streetlights flicker like warnings in the haze,  
But I move like a phantom, unfazed by the blaze.  

### **[Hook/Chorus]**  
Born in the chaos, I weather the storm,  
Rising from ashes where warriors are born.  
Chains couldn't hold me, the system’s a maze,  
I rewrite the rules, set the city ablaze!  

### **[Verse 2]**  
Barbed wire fences couldn't lock in my mind,  
Every cage they designed, I left broken behind.  
They want control, but I’m destined to roam,  
Where the lost find their voice, where the heart sets the tone.  
Steel and concrete, where the lessons run deep,  
Every crack in the pavement tells a story of heat.  
But I rise, undefeated, like a king with no throne,  
Writing scripts in the struggle, my legacy’s stone.  

### **[Bridge]**  
Feel the rhythm of the underground roar,  
Every wound tells a story of the battles before.  
Blood, sweat, and echoes fill the cold midnight,  
But we move with the fire—unshaken, upright.  

### **[Verse 3]**  
No regrets, no retreat, this game has no pause,  
Every step that I take is a win for the lost.  
I took lessons from hustlers, wisdom from pain,  
Now the echoes of struggle carve power in my name.  
They built walls, but I walk through the cracks,  
Turned dirt into gold, never looked back.  
Through the struggle we rise, through the fire we claim,  
This is more than just music—it's life in the frame.  

### **[Hook/Chorus – Reprise]**  
Born in the chaos, I weather the storm,  
Rising from ashes where warriors are born.  
Chains couldn't hold me, the system’s a maze,  
I rewrite the rules, set the city ablaze!  

### **[Outro – Spoken]**  
*"The scars, the struggle, the grind—it’s all part of the rhythm.  
We never break, we never fold. We rise."*
