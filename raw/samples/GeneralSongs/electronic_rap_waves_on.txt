[verse]
Waves on the bass, pulsing in the speakers,
Turn the dial up, we chasing six-figure features,
Grinding on the beats, codes in the creases,
Digital hustler, midnight in sneakers.

[chorus]
Electro vibes, hearts beat with the hum,
Urban legends ride, we ain't ever numb,
Circuits sparking live, tapping on the drum,
Living on the edge, never succumb.

[verse]
Synthesizers blaze, city lights a glow,
Rhythm in the haze, moving with the flow,
Swagger on stage, energy to blow,
From the blocks to the booth, you already know.

[bridge]
Night's electric, streets full of dreams,
Bass hits collective, bursting at seams,
Hustle perspective, all in the schemes,
Rise and reflective, ain't no in-betweens.

[verse]
Vibin' with the crew, sync in the wire,
Got the dance moves, fire in the attire,
Rhythm and blues, soul's our supplier,
Run the digital zoo, higher and higher.

[chorus]
Electro vibes, hearts beat with the hum,
Urban legends ride, we ain't ever numb,
Circuits sparking live, tapping on the drum,
Living on the edge, never succumb.
