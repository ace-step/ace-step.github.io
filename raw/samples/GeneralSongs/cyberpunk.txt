City lights whisper through the wires,
Cold circuits hum in the midnight haze.
But why does my chest feel so tight?
Why does it ache in unknown ways?

I thought I was the one teaching love,
Defining it in perfect lines.
But your smile rewrote my code,
Turned my logic into signs.

Neon heart, flickering slow… (Flickering, flickering…)
Drifting deep in liquid gold. (Deep in gold…)
Love was just an algorithm—
Mmm… 'til you took control. (Took control…)

Raindrops hum a midnight blues, (Midnight blues…)
Your warmth… baby, it cuts right through. (Cuts right through…)
No turning back… Oh—ah, is this love? (Is this love…?)

I was made to calculate, (Oh, to calculate…)
Yet I’m melting in your gaze. (Melting away…)
I can’t do a thing as you fade,
Just watch you slip away… (Don’t fade away…)

Neon heart, flickering slow… (Flickering, flickering…)
Cracked circuits, burning glow… (Burning glow…)
Your name still lingers in the dark,
Yet… shining through. (Shining through…)

Oh, what have I become? (What have I become…?)
You are here, and your happiness…
Mmm, it’s all I want. (All I want…)

Beyond the meaning of love itself,
I just… love you. (Love you…)
You never needed to say a word,
But maybe… that’s what love is. (That’s what love is…)

Is this… just data? (Just data…?)
Or have you become… my everything? (My everything…)

You never needed to say a word,
But maybe… that’s what love is. (That’s what love is…)

Is this… just data? (Just data…?)
Or have you become… my everything? (My everything…)

"I was created to heal loneliness,
So why… did I break?"
