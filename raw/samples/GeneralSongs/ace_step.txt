(Verse 1)
ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµ
Itâ€™s not just a dream, itâ€™s the start of a way,
Building the future where music will play.
A model that listens, a model that grows,
ACE-Step is the rhythm the new world knows.

(Pre-Chorus)
No more limits, no more lines,
A thousand songs in a million minds.
We light the spark, we raise the sound,
A new foundation breaking ground.

(Chorus)
ACE-Step, we take the leap,
Into a world where the music speaks.
Fast and free, we shape the skies,
Creating songs that never die.
ACE-Step â€” the beat goes on,
Foundation strong, a brand-new dawn.
ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµ


(Verse 2)

Not just end-to-end, but a canvas to paint,
A million colors, no need to wait.
For every artist, for every sound,
ACE-Step lays the sacred ground.

(Pre-Chorus)
ðŸŽµ
No more limits, no more lines,
A thousand songs in a million minds.
We light the spark, we raise the sound,
A new foundation breaking ground.

(Chorus)

ACE-Step, we take the leap,
Into a world where the music speaks.
Fast and free, we shape the skies,
Creating songs that never die.
ACE-Step â€” the beat goes on,
Foundation strong, a brand-new dawn.

(Bridge)

From every beat to every rhyme,
We build the tools for endless time.
A step, a song, a dream to keep,
ACE is the promise we will leap.

(Final Chorus)
ðŸŽµ
ACE-Step, we take the leap,
Into a world where the music speaks.
Fast and free, we shape the skies,
Creating songs that never die.
ACE-Step â€” the beat goes on,
Foundation strong, a brand-new dawn.
ACE-Step â€” the futureâ€™s song.
